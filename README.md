# Pointnet_keras-voxels

Original tensorflow implementation: https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet

Package requirement: Python3.6, keras, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, h5py

# Training:

1. Download the aligned dataset from https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/media/modelnet40_ply_hdf5_2048.zip.
2. Put all traning h5 files under Prepdata folder, all testing h5 files under Prepdata_test folder, then run train_cls.py.</br>
Accuracy rate will be 82%, which is slightly lower than the original implementation.
